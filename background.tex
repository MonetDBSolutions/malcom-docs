\section{Background}
\label{Background}
In this section we summarize the salient features of resilient intermediates
for query processing., the leading open-source column store and the envisioned
system ExaNest, an exascale HPC platform for data-intensive computing.

\subsection{A Column Store}
%Recap some MonetDB stuff on how queries are compiled.
MonetDB is a widely used column store that internally uses resident
intermediates to break up query processing in well identified steps.
The query plan is broken up into independent steps, glued together into a
dataflow dependency graph. The dataflow graph is greedily consumed by the
database kernel assigning a single core to a single operation.
The resource pressure is kept at a minimal to trim down the degree of parallel
processing when the main resource, RAM, is heavily used.
The system can be instructed to produce an event record for each completed instruction.
This provides a.o. insight into the input/output sizes and timing.

\subsection{Distributed Query Optimizers}
% summarize
The predominant scheme to scale out database processing is to break the base
tables into independent partitions using either a hash-key or ranges.
The partitioning scheme can be used to orchestrate distributed processing
in an optimal way most of the time.
